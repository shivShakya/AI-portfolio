  "description": "This project is something I've always wanted to work on... Problem: In my childhood, I used to enjoy making papercraft, designing toys, and creating architectural models. I often wondered what if I could sell these creations and earn my own pocket money.Furthermore, I noticed that there are many talented handicraft workers who lack a proper platform to showcase and sell their products. They often rely on local markets and struggle to reach a larger audience, limiting their growth potential. This is where my website, 'Craft Store,' comes into play.",
