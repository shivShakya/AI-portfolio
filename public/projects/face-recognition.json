  "title": "Fine-Tuning Stable Diffusion with Meta Segmentation",
  "description": "While working with AI-generated images, I realized that generating precise and structured outputs often requires more than just a general diffusion model. Fine-tuning a model with domain-specific knowledge can significantly enhance its capabilities. In this project, I fine-tuned Stable Diffusion with Meta's segmentation model to improve image generation by incorporating segmentation masks. This approach allows the model to understand and generate well-structured images with clear object boundaries. Over two months, I explored diffusion models, segmentation techniques, and deep learning optimizations to build a system capable of refining image generation using segmentation guidance. The project provided hands-on experience in model fine-tuning, dataset preprocessing, training deep learning models, and deploying AI-powered image generation systems.",
